                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Piyush, a freshman at Interlake High School interested in SWE and ML. I'm highly passionate about exploring different ways in which I can advance my skills in the branches of science while also tying it with my passion for computer science.

                        Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, Iâ€™ve witnessed the forefront of STEM and innovation on my doorstep. This inspired my love for problem-solving and creating early on, from doing competitive math/science to coding my first Python game.
                        
                        I've competed in a variety of science tournaments, and I recently traveled to Washington, D.C. to compete in the National Science Bowl hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, where my team and I won first place.
                        
                        I am also committed to developing large-scale open source projects - I have created and contributed to numerous projects on GitHub. When I'm not studying for upcoming competitions and tests, you can usually find me at my computer, tinkering away at a bioinformatics algorithm I invented for analyzing proteins in DNA.
                        
                        In addition to my passion for science and technology, I'm deeply committed to giving back to my community. 
                        
                        This is why I joined Mighty Crayon 2 years ago, with the mission of encouraging enjoyable and empowering experiences for children around the world through the use of recycled creative mediums. Today, as the Co-Executive Director, I have set a goal to deliver 100,000+ crayons and educational coloring books to children in need around the world by the end of 2023.
                        
                        Additionally, I am a Curriculum Developer Intern at the Nuevo Foundation, where I develop curricula for underprivileged students, including interactive courses for Python, Linux, EV3, cybersecurity, and other topics pertaining to technology.
                        
                        In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, tennis, swimming, and exploring the extensive Redmond trail system near my home either with my family or my DJI Mavic 3.</p>
